# Private Video Call System

A cutting-edge privacy-focused video calling platform built on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling secure and confidential video communications on the blockchain.

## üîê Core Concepts

### FHE Smart Contracts for Confidential Video Calls
This system leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to create a revolutionary privacy video system where:
- All video call metadata remains encrypted on-chain
- Participants can interact without revealing sensitive information
- Smart contracts process encrypted data without decryption
- End-to-end privacy is maintained throughout the entire communication process

### Privacy Video System Architecture
- **Encrypted Communication Channels**: All video streams are protected by advanced cryptographic protocols
- **Decentralized Identity Management**: User identities are managed through blockchain without exposing personal data
- **Confidential Call Routing**: Call connections are established through encrypted smart contract interactions
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: System metrics are collected without compromising user privacy
